IMPORTANT: CSS FILE NEEDED

The file css/styles.css exists but needs the full CSS content.

You can:
1. Copy the CSS from your previous single-page version (styles.css from the old site)
2. Or I can provide it separately

The CSS is the same - just needs to be in the css/ folder instead of root.

All HTML files are correctly linked to css/styles.css already!
