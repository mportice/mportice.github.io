                <p>When approaching any design, it is important to consider the manner in which it will be manufactured. 3D Printing, though a very lenient method of manufacturing, has several properties that should be considered when designing parts that you intend to print.</p>
                
                <p>Here I will go over some of the basic guidelines to follow as you're designing 3D Printed parts. Use these to consider the geometry and functions of what you are designing</p>

                <h2>A Quick Overview of how 3D Printers Work</h2>
                
                <img src="..\images\logo.png" alt="place holder">

                <p>3D printing works by laying down lines of plastic one layer at a time. This is essential to take into consideration in your designs, as 3D printing is a slight misnomer.</p>
                
                <p>If we break down our thinking of the 3D printing process into how it builds up a model, it is essentially drawing out a 2D slice of your part, and stacking them all on top of one another. This is where the term <a href="https://wikipedia.org/wiki/Slicer_(3D_printing)">slicing</a> comes from.</p>

                <p>This layer by layer process is the most important thing to remember as you're reading the rest this article.</p>

                <p>Time constraints work similarly. When you have six months instead of two years, you can't afford to explore every possible approach. You must make decisive calls early and iterate rapidly.</p>
                
                <p>The key is distinguishing between healthy constraints and artificial limitations. Manufacturing realities are healthy constraints—they push you toward practical solutions.</p>
