                <p>There's a pervasive myth in engineering and design that more resources lead to better solutions. More time, more budget, more materials—surely these are always beneficial? But after years of working on projects ranging from robotics to prosthetics, I've come to believe the opposite is often true.</p>
                
                <p>Constraints force creativity in ways that unlimited freedom never can. When you can't solve a problem with brute force, you're pushed to find elegant solutions that work within reality.</p>

                <h2>The Manufacturing Reality Check</h2>
                
                <p>Consider the 3D printed prosthetic project. The constraint wasn't just cost—it was the entire ecosystem of developing regions. We couldn't rely on specialized materials, precision electronics, or expert assembly.</p>
                
                <p>This forced us to design differently. Instead of miniaturized actuators, we used simple servo motors and fishing line. The constraints led us to solutions that were not just cheaper, but more robust and repairable.

                <h2>Speed as a Forcing Function</h2>
                
                <p>Time constraints work similarly. When you have six months instead of two years, you can't afford to explore every possible approach. You must make decisive calls early and iterate rapidly.</p>
                
                <p>The key is distinguishing between healthy constraints and artificial limitations. Manufacturing realities are healthy constraints—they push you toward practical solutions.</p>
